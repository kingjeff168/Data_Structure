Consider a network of social contacts being exposed to a transmissible disease. 
The network can be represented using a graph, where the vertices represent people and edges represent relationships. 
Relationships are categorized as frequent and occasional contacts, represented by edge labels of 1 and 2, respectively. 

Consider all relationships to be reciprocal, resulting in an undirected graph.

A graph will consist of one or more connected components. Note that there are no paths between nodes that are in different connected components. Also, it is possible for a single node to be isolated, leading to a connected component consisting of just that node.

Run:
./connected [filename] [label]
